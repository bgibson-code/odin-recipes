    <h1>Zesty Beef Rainbow Veggie Rice Bowl</h1>
    <h2>Zesty, Tasty, Fresh. What is not to like about this Beef and rainbow veggie rice bowl!</h2>
    <p>A masterful blend of flavors, combining tender grass-fed beef, fresh veggies, and organic brown rice.</p>
    <p>With a few simple ingredients we can create this dish in all of its glory to be enjoyed from the comfort of your own home. I usually like to make recipes
            like this one in bulk to be portioned off and frozen for delectible meal prep.</p>
    <p>We can throw this meal together if only a few simple steps, involving a few simple ingredients.</p>
